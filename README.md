# Does Being Green = Saved Ultility Costs for Businesses?
This a tool using data from the [2018 NYC Business Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Value-of-Energy-Cost-Savings-Program-Savings-for-B/ukdt-xm28) and the [2015 Tree Census](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2015-Street-Tree-Census-Tree-Data/pi5s-9p35) to build a simple predictive model to estimate how much a business might <b> save </b> in ulitity costs  if it invested in <b> green initatives </b> like tree planting or enrolling in a business association.

This project is a part of the 2019 NYC Open Data Competition. 

## Further Steps
- If we had more time, we would like to have optimized the model further because we suspect that there is a model that drastically reduces variance and bias.
- I orginally worked on coding the different categorical variables into our model and thus introducing interesting factors and would like to work on that
